## Features

- Search NIH-funded research projects with various criteria:
  - Fiscal years
  - Principal Investigator names
  - Organization details (name, state, city, type, department)
  - Funding amounts
  - COVID-19 response status
  - Funding mechanism
  - Institute/Center codes
  - RCDC terms
  - Date ranges
- Search publications associated with NIH projects
- Combined search functionality for both projects and publications
- Detailed project and publication information including abstracts
- Configurable result limits

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- UV package manager (recommended for faster dependency installation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mcp-nih-reporter
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies using UV:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```
## Usage

This MCP server provides access to the NIH RePORTER API through several tools:

- `search_projects`: Search for NIH-funded research projects
- `search_publications`: Search for publications associated with NIH projects
- `search_combined`: Combined search for both projects and publications
- `test_connection`: Test the API connection

You can use this MCP with any MCP-compatible client, such as:
- Claude Desktop
- Cursor
- Other MCP-enabled tools

### Example claude_desktop_config.json
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
	 "nih-reporter": {
	      "command": "<fully qualified path to>/uv",
	      "args": [
	        "run",
	        "--with",
	        "mcp[cli]",
	        "mcp",
	        "run",
	        "<fully qualified path to>/mcp-nih-reporter/mcp-nih-reporter.py"
	      ]
	    }
  }
}
```

The search results will be returned in a structured format containing project details including:
- Project title and abstract
- Principal Investigator information
- Organization details
- Funding information
- Project dates and status

## Debugging

A log file will be created in the root folder when the MCP attempts to run in a client (e.g. Claude Desktop). Check there if you're having trouble.

## Development

The project uses:
- `httpx` for async HTTP requests
- `mcp` for the Mission Control Protocol implementation
- `python-dotenv` for environment variable management
- `uv` for dependency management

## Logging

Logs are written to `mcp-nih-reporter.log` in the project root directory. The logging level is set to INFO by default.
